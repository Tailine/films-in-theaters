# Python scraper

## Motivation

I wanted a fast way to check the available films and times for the movie theater I usually go to.

## Description

Using the **Beautiful Soup** library to scrape the data, the script gets the films in the movie theater for the city of **Salvador** at Cinemark and the information about the available session, time, language and also the links to buy the tickets. The results are written in a text file.
